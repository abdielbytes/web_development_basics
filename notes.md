# Day 1: Introduction to CSS

## Project: Style the Personal Webpage

### Project Overview:
- In this project, you'll style the personal webpage created on **Week 1, Day 1** using inline, internal, and external CSS styles. By applying CSS, you'll learn how to control the visual presentation of your HTML elements.

### Features:
1. **Inline CSS**: Apply styles directly to HTML elements (e.g., the hobbies list).
2. **Internal CSS**: Use the `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` to define styles for multiple elements.
3. **External CSS**: Prepare for external styling by linking to an external stylesheet (though the file is not yet created, this sets up good practices).

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand how to use CSS to style HTML elements.
- Learn the different methods of applying CSS: Inline, internal, and external.
- Practice basic CSS properties such as fonts, colors, background, and text alignment.

### Exercise:
1. **Apply Inline CSS**:
   - Style the hobbies list items directly using inline CSS. For example, change the color of the text or make the text italicized.

2. **Apply Internal CSS**:
   - Use the `<style>` tag to define styles for your webpage elements, such as the body, header, and paragraphs. You can experiment with different font families, background colors, and text alignments.

3. **Prepare for External CSS**:
   - Though this day focuses on inline and internal CSS, include the `<link>` tag for external CSS in the `<head>` section of your document. This prepares your webpage to use an external CSS file in the future.
